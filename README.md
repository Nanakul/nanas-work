A collection of practice problems and programs I'm working on/finished.

About me: 

Hi all, my name is Midi. I'm new to coding and I am currently trying to switch career paths. I graduated from the University of Washington
with a Bachelor's in Business Finance. Business isn't what I originally wanted to do, I wanted to pursue Computer Science, but I was 
already so close to finishing my BA in Business, so I stuck with it.

I thought that maybe if I worked in the industry for a while, I'd start to like it, but that just isn't the case. I am currently back in
school and taking computer science classes. After finishing the two prerequisite CS courses, I am going to try applying for the GCSDD 
(Graduate Certificate in Software Design & Development) at UW. It's a one year graduate certification program that is equivalent to that of
an undergrad degree in CS, as it allows me to either work in the field upon completion, or apply directly to the MBA program in Software
Engineering or Cybersecurity.

My current goal is to get into the program, finish it, and go for an MBA.

I am very passionate about video games. I was first introduced to video games when I was in first grade, as my older brother got me into
Diablo and Diablo 2. I ended up becoming addicted to Diablo 2, and along the way I encountered Runescape, which I also played alongside
Diablo. I've owned many game consoles, such as the Dreamcast, NES classic and SNES, N64, Xbox, Playstation, and everything up to the Xbox
One. 

During my early years of gaming, I decided to take up competitive gaming for games such as Halo, Gears of War, and Call of Duty.
In my more recent years, as I transitioned over to PC gaming, I played League of Legends and Counter-Strike very competitively. During this
time, I began streaming on Twitch, and continued to do so for the next three years.

I'm trying to do anything I can to get out of the finance industry. I would like to work in the video game/tech industry because it is what
I am passionate for.

If you are able to help me in any way, whether it's advice on getting into the industry or help with my coding work/projects, please get
in touch with me! I'd love to connect with anyone and learn as much as I can!

Thanks for reading!
